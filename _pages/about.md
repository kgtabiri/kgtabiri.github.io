Welcome! I am a second year student in the PhD Economics program at [Carleton Uviersity](https://carleton.ca/economics/people/kwasi-tabiri/). I am also a research assistant with Prof. [Erin Strumpf](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/erin-strumpf) on a project developing a new difference-in-difference technique for dealing with siloed data. 

My primary research interest is in health economics. Currently, I am working on understanding how early life circumstances affect later life outcomes in developing countries.
