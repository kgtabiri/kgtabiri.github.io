Welcome! I am a second year student in the PhD Economics program at [Carleton Uviersity](https://carleton.ca/economics/people/kwasi-tabiri/). My primary research interest is in health economics. I am interested in issues related to the formation of health human capital and the economic consequences of shocks to human capital in both developing and developing countries.
